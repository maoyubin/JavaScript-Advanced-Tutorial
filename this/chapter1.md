## Exercises  

1.How many cables would be needed in a complete, routerless network of 100 computers? What are the minimum number of cables required in the same configuration of the network with 100 computers if a single router is added as a hub?  

To calculate the number of lines (number of cables to connect the devices) in a complete, routerless network , we can use this formula:  
K = n(n-1)/2;  
100 computes will use 4950.  
Only 100 cables is needed when a single router is added as a hub.  

2.Imagine an application that needs to send data from a client to a server at a very specific rate. Once started, the application will likely run for days at a time. Which network architecture, packet switching or circuit switching best suits this particular application and why?  

The circuit switching is suit for this situation.  
Because every communicating node on a circuit-switching network has a dedicated communication channel.  
So it is more reliable than packet switching.  

3.Imagine an application that sends data from a server to a client very sporadically. The amount of data sent at any one time is small and the time to delivery is not time-sensitive. Which network architecture, packet switching or circuit switching best suits this particular application and why?  

The packet switching is suit for situation.  
The amount of data is sent at any time and its delivery is efficient and not time-sensitive.
