# *this* & Object Prototypes
# Chapter 2: `this` All Makes Sense Now!

In Chapter 1, we discarded various misconceptions about `this` and learned instead that `this` is a binding made for each function invocation, based entirely on its **call-site** (how the function is called).

## Call-site

To understand `this` binding, we have to understand the call-site: the location in code where a function is called (**not where it's declared**). We must inspect the call-site to answer the question: what's *this* `this` a reference to?

Finding the call-site is generally: "go locate where a function is called from", but it's not always that easy, as certain coding patterns can obscure the *true* call-site.

What's important is to think about the **call-stack** (the stack of functions that have been called to get us to the current moment in execution). The call-site we care about is *in* the invocation *before* the currently executing function.

Let's demonstrate call-stack and call-site:

```js
function baz() {
    // call-stack is: `baz`
    // so, our call-site is in the global scope

    console.log( "baz" );
    bar(); // <-- call-site for `bar`
}

function bar() {
    // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar`
    // so, our call-site is in `baz`

    console.log( "bar" );
    foo(); // <-- call-site for `foo`
}

function foo() {
    // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar` -> `foo`
    // so, our call-site is in `bar`

    console.log( "foo" );
}

baz(); // <-- call-site for `baz`
```

Take care when analyzing code to find the actual call-site (from the call-stack), because it's the only thing that matters for `this` binding.

## Nothing But Rules

We turn our attention now to *how* the call-site determines where `this` will point during the execution of a function.

You must inspect the call-site and determine which of 4 rules applies. We will first explain each of these 4 rules independently, and then we will illustrate their order of precedence, if multiple rules *could* apply to the call-site.

### Default Binding

The first rule we will examine comes from the most common case of function calls: standalone function invocation. Think of *this* `this` rule as the default catch-all rule when none of the other rules apply.

Consider this code:

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

foo(); // 2
```

The first thing to note, if you were not already aware, is that variables declared in the global scope, as `var a = 2` is, are synonymous with global-object properties of the same name. They're not copies of each other, they *are* each other. Think of it as two sides of the same coin.

Secondly, we see that when `foo()` is called, `this.a` resolves to our global variable `a`. Why? Because in this case, the *default binding* for `this` applies to the function call, and so points `this` at the global object.

How do we know that the *default binding* rule applies here? We examine the call-site to see how `foo()` is called. In our snippet, `foo()` is called with a plain, un-decorated function reference. None of the other rules we will demonstrate will apply here, so the *default binding* applies instead.

If `strict mode` is in effect, the global object is not eligible for the *default binding*, so the `this` is instead set to `undefined`.

```js
function foo() {
	"use strict";

	console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

foo(); // TypeError: `this` is `undefined`
```

A subtle but important detail is: even though the overall `this` binding rules are entirely based on the call-site, the global object is **only** eligible for the *default binding* if the **contents** of `foo()` are **not** running in `strict mode`; the `strict mode` state of the call-site of `foo()` is irrelevant.

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

(function(){
	"use strict";

	foo(); // 2
})();
```

**Note:** Intentionally mixing `strict mode` and non-`strict mode` together in your own code is generally frowned upon. Your entire program should probably either be **Strict** or **non-Strict**. However, sometimes you include a third-party library that has different **Strict**'ness than your own code, so care must be taken over these subtle compatibility details.
